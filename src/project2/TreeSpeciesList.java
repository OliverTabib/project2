/*
  The TreeSpeciesList class should be used to store all the unique TreeSpecies 
  objects. This class should inherit from the ArrayList<TreeSpecies> class. 
 (Some of you may realize that a HashTable would probably be a better choice here. 
  For the purpose of this project, you should NOT use the HashTable or any other 
  hashing data structure).

 The class needs to provide a default constructor that creates an empty 
 TreeSpeciesList object.
